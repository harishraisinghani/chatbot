    "We will be building a simple **retrieval-based** chatbot, which selects a response from a library of predefined responses based on the context of the conversation. A more intelligent type of chatbot is a **generative** bot which can create answers which are not always from the library.\n",

    "### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is the study of interactions between human language and computers, where computers analyze understand and derive meaning from human lanugage in a smart and useful way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall flow to our NLP exercise today looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Identify a *corpus* or body of text data used as the response library \n",
    "        For this exercise, we will use the *Memorable Cornell Movie-Quotes Corpus* which is a dataset of over  \n",
    "        200,000 conversational exchanges between 10,000+ pairs of movie characters! See \n",
    "        https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Pre-process this text data which includes:\n",
    "         * Converting all the text to *lowercase*\n",
    "         \n",
    "         * Removing movie line numbers\n",
    "         \n",
    "         * Removing all punctuations\n",
    "         \n",
    "         * Removing **stop words** which are extremely common words (such as 'has', 'is', 'of') which would \n",
    "         appear to be of little value in helping select the response. \n",
    "         \n",
    "         * Tokenizing the text, which simply means converting the text 'strings' into a list of both individual \n",
    "         words and sentences. We will have both *sentence_token* and *word_token* lists. \n",
    "         \n",
    "         * Lemmatization which is reducing a word to its *stem* as well as combining similar words into the same \n",
    "         lemma. So for example, \"run\" is the lemma for words like \"running\", \"runs\", or \"ran\". \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Creating a 'Bag of Words'\n",
    "        A 'Bag of Words' is a representation of the text which describes the occurrence of words within a \n",
    "        document and includes:\n",
    "         * A vocabulary of known words\n",
    "         \n",
    "         * A measure of whether the known words occur in the document\n",
    "\n",
    "        The representation of the text is transformed into a vector (or array) of numbers. So for example, if our \n",
    "        vocabulary of known words is: `{Learning, is, the, not, great}` and we want to vectorize the text \n",
    "        \"Learning is great\" then the vector representation of that text is simply: `(1,1,0,0,1)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Scaling word frequency\n",
    "        We won't get into the mathematical details here, but essentially, a problem with the Bag of Words \n",
    "        approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document. One way to address this is to \n",
    "        apply a scaling factor to the frequency of words so that higher frequent words are penalized so that they \n",
    "        have less weighting, both within a document and across multiple documents. This is done by using the \n",
    "        following:\n",
    "         * Term Frequency (TF) - a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document\n",
    "         * Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) - a scoring of how rare the word is across multiple documents\n",
    "\n",
    "        Together, the **TF-IDF** weighting is used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a \n",
    "        collection or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Calculating similarity\n",
    "        The nice thing about converting text into numerical vectors is that you can now use math to calculate how \n",
    "        similar (aligned) or disimilar (opposed) the input text is to the text in the vocabulary of known words. \n",
    "        Two vectors closely aligned have a cosine of the angle between them close to 1, and when opposed, the \n",
    "        cosine is -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Identify most similar text vector and send back as response\n"

I know we are not fond of this word, but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform. We must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid. The reason for this work is information. The method is interrogation. And interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result, or rather, an answer. In practice, demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence. I am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly. However, success does not depend solely on us. We need to have the Casbah at our disposal. We must sift through it ... and interrogate everyone. And here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative, as if Algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground. We have requested a carte blanche. But it is very difficult to obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention, and make it possible. It is necessary to create it ourselves -- this excuse.

One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Stickleton slugging it out. But who remembers Carl Potts? Driving this rebuilt Wittigan for lodyne Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF, a forgettable and pathetic finish, so bad that afterwards, lodyne stock dropped six points. But as Ben Burns sat guzzling cold, fresh milk in Victory Lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a 12-point gain, which immediately blocked Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete takeover. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of lodyne, Inc., in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent lodyne into the gains record book, the only record book that matters. Look out that window. There isn\\'t a single plane or helicopter or K-Harrier that isn\\'t powered by lodyne fuel cells. That\\'s what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars or drivers.

And they say there is no fate, but there is: it\\'s what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn\\'t really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I\\'ve felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I\\'ve been pretending I\\'m OK, just to get along, just for, I don\\'t know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own.

perform. we must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid. the reason for this work is information. the method is interrogation. and interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result, or rather, an answer. in practice, demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence. i am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly. however, success does not depend solely on us. we need to have the casbah at our disposal. we must sift through it ... and interrogate everyone. and here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative, as if algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground. we have requested a carte blanche. but it is very difficult to obtain. therefore, it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention, and make it possible. it is necessary to create it ourselves -- this excuse. unless our adversaries will think of it themselves, which seems to be what they are doing.\\n\\nlake placid\\ni\\'m a civilian, not a trout - you have no
